### Simulations - Astronomy, Particle, Fluid, Atomic, Molecular
An entire interactive program for creating and visualizing many different simulation, it will include black hole simulation, galaxy simualtion, fluid and smoke, particle, atomic, and biomolecular as well. Built in C using OpenGL. Hoping to learn more about graphics programming, and a bit of everything else at the same time.
